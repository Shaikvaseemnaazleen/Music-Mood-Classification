# Music-Mood-Classification
The aim of the project was to develop a music mood classifier. There are many categories of mood into which songs may be classified, e.g. happy, sad, angry, brooding, calm, uplifting, etc. People listen to different kinds of music depending on their mood. The development of a framework for estimation of musical mood, robust to the tremendous variability of musical content across genres, artists, world regions and time periods, is an interesting and challenging problem with wide applications in the music industry.
